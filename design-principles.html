          <p class="section1">
            Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show
            their order of importance. Designers structure visual
            characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information
            easily. By laying out elements logically and strategically,
            designers influence users’ perceptions and guide them to desired
            actions.

          <p class="section2">
            The rule of thirds is a composition guideline that places your
            subject in the left or right third of an image, leaving the other
            two thirds more open. While there are other forms of composition,
            the rule of thirds generally leads to compelling and well-composed
            shots. If you imagine dividing a photo, or even your camera’s
            viewfinder, into nine equal zones using horizontal and vertical
            lines, that forms your rule-of-thirds grid — a setting you can
            select on most cameras and even on your phone.

          <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

          <p class="section3">
            White space is the area between design elements. It is also the
            space within individual design elements, including the space between
            typography glyphs (readable characters). Despite its name, white
            space does not need to be white. It can be any color, texture,
            pattern, or even a background image. White space can cause problems
            between designers and clients. Design theory promotes the use of
            white space for elegance and ensuring a quality user experience.
            Sadly, many clients and managers consider white space wasted space.
            They think it could be used to house more information or other
            visual elements.
